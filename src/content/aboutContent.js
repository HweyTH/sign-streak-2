    A couple first words.

    Thank you for visiting!

    This project starts during the spring of 2025. It started with coming up with an idea for our hackathon project during Delta Hacks XIX.
    The initial idea was to create a fun experience that would help people learn and practice sign language, especially American Sign Language.
    That was when me and my team started brainstorming and then fixated on the idea of creating a sign language typing game.
    However, the tools we used to build the first version of Sign Streak was not the best. 
    As it turns out, PyQT and Flask were not the best tools for the job and nor did we have the best experience building UI with them.
    So, after the hackathon, I took it upon myself to build another version of Sign Streak using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
    The new version is a lot more polished and has a lot more features. 
    I'm not sure if I'll be able to continue working on this project, but I'll try my best to keep it updated.

    If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contacct me through the links in the footer.
